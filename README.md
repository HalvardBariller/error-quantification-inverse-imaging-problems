# error-quantification-inverse-imaging-problems
Project on error bounds in Bayesian regularization of inverse imaging problems for the MVA class "Generative Modeling for Images".

This project is based on the article ["Posterior-Variance-Based Error Quantification for Inverse Problems in Imaging"](Posterior-Variance-Based%20Error%20Quantification%20for%20Inverse%20Problems%20in%20Imaging.pdf) (Narnhofer et al., 2022).
